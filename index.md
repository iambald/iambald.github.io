Hey, I'm Jeff! I was born and raised in the Bay Area, and I'm living in San Francisco right now. I studied **computer science** with a minor in human-computer interaction at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu/), and graduated in May 2016. I currently work at [Ladder Life](https://ladderlife.com/) as a full-stack software engineer.

Since everyone asks eventually, I have [alopecia areata universalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia_universalis), so I'm (almost) completely hairless. Yes, even there.

I ran track for **12** years, but I've hung up my spikes for good. I was a captain of the CMU track team and briefly held the 60 meter school record.
